refs.packedRefsVersion::
	Specifies the file format version to use when writing a `packed-refs`
	file. Defaults to `1`.
+
The only other value currently allowed is `2`, which uses a structured file
format to result in a smaller `packed-refs` file. In order to write this
file format version, the repository must also have the `packed-v2` extension
enabled. The most typical setup will include the
`core.repositoryFormatVersion=1` config value and the `extensions.refFormat`
key will have three values: `files`, `packed`, and `packed-v2`.
+
If `extensions.refFormat` has the value `packed-v2` and not `packed`, then
`refs.packedRefsVersion` defaults to `2`.
